  <span>Building a heap from scratch</span>
  <span>
    A heap is a data structure that can be represented as an array
    the ordering of elements in the array represent the structure of the heap
    let's take an example  [100, 19, 36, 17, 3, 25, 1, 2, 7]
    
    given a node at index i, its children are at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 1
    we can see this in the example, 100 is at index 0 and its children are at
    1 and 2.

    36 is at index 2, and its children are at 5 and 6.

    How can we verify that this is a heap? and how do we ensure this is a heap as we add
    and remove elements?

  <div id="fig1"></div>

  <style>
    .dot {
      width: 20px;
      height: 20px;
      border-radius: 50%;
      background-color: black;
    }
  </style>
  <script>
    const fig1 = document.getElementById("fig1")
    const newEl = document.createElement('div')
    const nodes = [1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 13, 10, 9, 8, 15, 17];
    newEl.className = "dot"
    fig1.appendChild(newEl);
